This is a collection of custom-made "predicates" that can check for things ordinary predicates cannot

*** EXAMPLES ***
****************
Works similarly to how regular predicates work, except we're testing for the output result of a function

~~~~~
/execute if function ac_lib:c_predicate/mob_griefing run say Mob Griefing is enabled

/execute unless function ac_lib:c_predicate/mob_griefing run say Mob Griefing is disabled
