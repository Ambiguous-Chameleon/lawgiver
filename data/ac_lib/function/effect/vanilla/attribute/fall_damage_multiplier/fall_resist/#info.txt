Removes fall damage



*** EXAMPLES ***
****************
Temp should be used for if the intended target is in the air and you want them to negate fall damage ONCE, but then re-enable fall damage for them after they've landed.

# Turn fall damage off. More long-term. Entity will maintain their fall resistance until it is switched back off manually
/function ac_lib:effect/vanilla/attribute/fall_damage_multiplier/fall_resist/do
/function ac_lib:effect/vanilla/attribute/fall_damage_multiplier/fall_resist/remove

# Temporary fall resistance. Will automatically be switched off once the entity makes contact with the ground
